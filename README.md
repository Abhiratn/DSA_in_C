## Introduction

This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of various data structures and algorithms using the C programming language. Understanding DSA is crucial for enhancing problem-solving skills and optimizing code efficiency.

## Array

Explore the `array` directory to find implementations of various array-related algorithms, operations, and problem-solving techniques. Arrays are the simplest form of data structure, and mastering them is essential for building a solid foundation in DSA.

## Linked List

The `linked-list` directory contains implementations of singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. Linked lists are fundamental for understanding dynamic data structures and memory management.

## Structure

In the `structure` directory, you'll find examples of creating and manipulating structures in C. Structures allow you to group different data types under a single entity, enabling you to represent more complex data structures.

## Stack

The `stack` directory provides implementations of the stack data structure. Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle and are widely used in programming and algorithm design.

## Sorting Algorithms

Discover various sorting algorithms in the `sorting-algorithms` directory. Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science, and understanding different sorting techniques is essential for efficient data organization.

## Upcoming Content

We're continuously working on adding more content to this repository. Expect to see upcoming additions, including more advanced algorithms, tree structures, graph algorithms, and more. Stay tuned for exciting updates!
